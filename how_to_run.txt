HOW TO EASILY RUN BRUTE FORCE 
(requires igraph for python)

->> inside a folder:
       -> folders of networks that you want to run brute force attack named as "netxx"
       -> bruteforce_v2.py (can be changed by editing the following file)
       -> run_one_part_iteration.sh

->> execute "run_one_part_iteration.sh" in a terminal:
       -> must pass an integer from 1 to 4 as argument (ARG)
       -> it runs 1/4 of comb(100,n)       

bash run_one_part_iteration.sh ARG
